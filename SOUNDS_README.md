# Ivory Castle - Sound Files

The game requires the following sound files in the same directory as index.html:

## Provided Sound Files:
- ✅ **Arrow.mp3** - Plays when player gets Archer protection
- ✅ **Winner.m4a** - Plays when a player wins the game
- ✅ **IC_Board.png** - The game board image

## Sound Files You Need to Add:
Please add these sound effect files to complete the game experience:

1. **dice-roll.mp3** - Sound when rolling the dice
2. **move.mp3** - Sound for normal movement
3. **happy.mp3** - Cheerful sound when jumping forward
4. **sad.mp3** - Disappointed sound when moving backward
5. **extra-turn.mp3** - Exciting sound when getting an extra turn
6. **miss-turn.mp3** - Sound when missing a turn

## How to Add Sounds:

2. Add the missing sound files
3. Open index.html in a web browser
4. Enjoy playing Ivory Castle!
