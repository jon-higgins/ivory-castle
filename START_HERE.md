3. Start game:
   - Player 1: **"Jammy"** ← exact spelling!

4. Watch it work!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check #1: File Updated?
Look at file date/time - should be newest version

### Check #2: Cache Cleared?
Try opening in **Incognito/Private mode**

### Check #3: Name Correct?
Must be exactly: `Jammy` (capital J)

### Check #4: Console Open?
Press F12 - need console to see easter egg
